# JIRA to Sheet


Creation and automation of Metrics in Projects using Jira Software.
Using Google Sheet as a support we can see the status of the functionalities, the changes of state that occurred, how long it was in each one and how many rework the team performed.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
$ brew install python3

### Optional ###
python3 -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
### Optional ### 

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Initial Configuration

Rename `example.json` to `variables.json` and add all the parameters you need.

## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
